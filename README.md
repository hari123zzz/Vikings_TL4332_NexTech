Energy optimization in College campusus
        Our project depends on air conditioning system  that integrates a Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor to optimize temperature control and energy efficiency. Traditional air conditioning systems often rely on 
manual adjustments or fixed schedules, leading to energy wastage and  discomfort.  In  contrast,  this  innovative  system  leverages  PIR sensor technology to detect human presence in a room accurately. When  occupants  are  detected,  the  system  adjusts  the  cooling  or 
heating  output  to  maintain  a  comfortable  temperature,  reducing energy consumption during vacant periods.

The PIR sensor, sensitive to infrared radiation emitted by humans, acts as an occupancy detector. When it senses movement, the system activates the air conditioning unit, ensuring that the environment 
remains comfortable for occupants. Conversely, when no motion is detected for a specified period, the system enters an energy-saving mode, adjusting the temperature setpoint to minimize energy usage. 
This technology represents a significant advancement in both user comfort  and  energy  conservation.  By  responding  to  real-time occupancy  data,  the  temperature-controlled  AC  system  optimizes cooling  or  heating,  resulting  in  reduced  energy  bills  and  a  lower 
environmental impact.
